## 🚨 The Problem

According to the **World Health Organization**, an estimated **1 in 10 medical products** in low- and middle-income countries is substandard or falsified. In India alone:

- 🏥 **20%** of medicines sold are estimated to be counterfeit or substandard
- 💀 **7 lakh people** die annually from substandard antimalarials and antibiotics in Africa and Asia
- 💰 **₹3,500 crore+** worth of fake medicines are seized annually in India
- 🔬 Counterfeit medicines may contain **wrong active ingredients**, **incorrect dosages**, **chalk powder**, **floor wax**, or **toxic substances**

**The Root Cause?** The existing supply chain lacks a unified digital traceability system. Medicines change hands from manufacturer → distributor → retailer with no verifiable digital custody trail. Recalls are slow. Counterfeiting is easy. Patients have no way to verify authenticity.

---

## 💡 Our Solution

**MedTrace** is an end-to-end pharmaceutical supply chain traceability framework that:

1. **Assigns a unique digital identity** to every medicine unit at the moment of manufacture
2. **Tracks every ownership transfer** digitally — manufacturer to distributor to retailer
3. **Enables instant verification** by any consumer by scanning a QR code
4. **Propagates recalls in real time** across the entire distribution network
5. **Provides a B2B marketplace** for transparent medicine procurement
6. **Generates GST-compliant invoices** automatically at every dispatch
7. **Works offline** — scans queue and sync when connectivity restores

---

## 📢 News

`2026-01-31` 🎉 **MedTrace v1.0 Released** — All five stakeholder portals live. 12,000 QR codes tracked in pilot with zero counterfeit breach.

`2025-11-01` 🚀 **Development started** — Project kicked off after literature gap analysis confirmed no open-source end-to-end solution existed.

### Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **Firebase over self-hosted DB** | Managed infrastructure, real-time listeners, free tier generous enough for production pilot |
| **Next.js over CRA** | Server-side rendering for faster initial load on low-end mobile devices |
| **JWT over sessions** | Stateless auth scales to multiple server instances without session store |
| **QR over RFID** | QR scannable by any smartphone with no hardware cost. RFID requires dedicated readers. |
| **Centralized over blockchain** | Blockchain adds latency and complexity without solving the core data integrity problem for this use case. Our signed QR + audit log approach provides equivalent tamper evidence. |
| **Client-side PDF** | Reduces server load; invoice generation is purely deterministic from Firestore data |

## 🔄 Traceability Flow
<img width="479" height="420" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b8ac477-8c40-4d3a-889b-f75213277058" />

```
STEP 1 — MANUFACTURE
  Manufacturer registers product → creates batch → generates QR hierarchy
  QR codes: Carton → Box → Strip → Unit (parent-child linked)
  Every QR = unique URL: https://medtrace.app/verify/{unique_id}

STEP 2 — DISPATCH TO DISTRIBUTOR
  Manufacturer selects distributor → adds batches → confirms dispatch
  Digital ownership transfers instantly
  GST invoice auto-generated and stored

STEP 3 — DISTRIBUTOR RECEIVES
  Distributor clicks "Receive & Add to Stock"
  Inventory updates in real time
  Distributor can now sell to retailers

STEP 4 — RETAILER ORDERS
  Retailer browses B2B marketplace → places order
  Distributor approves → dispatches → retailer receives
  POS terminal tracks every unit sold

STEP 5 — CONSUMER VERIFIES
  Consumer scans QR code on any strip/box/carton
  System resolves full chain: who made it, who handled it
  Result: Genuine ✅ / Expired ⏰ / Recalled 🚨 / Invalid ❓

RECALL FLOW (any time)
  Manufacturer triggers recall with reason
  Cloud Function fires → updates all affected batch records
  All distributors + retailers with that batch get instant alert
  Any future consumer scan shows red recall warning
```

---

## 🔳 QR Code System

### Unique Digital Identity (UDI) Format

Every QR code encodes a secure URL:
```
https://medtrace.app/verify/MTR-{MANUFACTURER_ID}-{BATCH_ID}-{STRIP_ID}-{UNIT_INDEX}-{CHECKSUM}

Example:
https://medtrace.app/verify/MTR-PGL-20250042-STR00891-U0012-A7F3
```

### Packaging Hierarchy

```
Carton QR  →  MTR-PGL-20250042-CTN-001
  │
  ├── Box QR  →  MTR-PGL-20250042-BOX-001-01
  │     ├── Strip QR  →  MTR-PGL-20250042-STR-001-01-01
  │     │     └── Unit QR  →  MTR-PGL-20250042-UNT-001-01-01-001
  │     └── Strip QR  →  MTR-PGL-20250042-STR-001-01-02
  │
  └── Box QR  →  MTR-PGL-20250042-BOX-001-02
```

**Parent resolution:** Scanning a Carton QR automatically resolves and updates all linked Boxes, Strips, and Units. A distributor receiving a shipment can scan one carton QR to accept all 2,400 units inside.

### QR Generation Engine

```javascript
// Simplified QR generation logic (Cloud Function)
async function generateBatchQRs(batch) {
  const { batchId, hierarchy } = batch;
  const { cartonsPerBatch, boxesPerCarton, stripsPerBox, unitsPerStrip } = hierarchy;

  for (let c = 0; c < cartonsPerBatch; c++) {
    const cartonId = `CTN-${String(c+1).padStart(3,'0')}`;
    await createQR('carton', batchId, cartonId, null);

    for (let b = 0; b < boxesPerCarton; b++) {
      const boxId = `BOX-${cartonId}-${String(b+1).padStart(2,'0')}`;
      await createQR('box', batchId, boxId, cartonId);

      for (let s = 0; s < stripsPerBox; s++) {
        const stripId = `STR-${boxId}-${String(s+1).padStart(2,'0')}`;
        await createQR('strip', batchId, stripId, boxId);

        for (let u = 0; u < unitsPerStrip; u++) {
          const unitId = `UNT-${stripId}-${String(u+1).padStart(3,'0')}`;
          await createQR('unit', batchId, unitId, stripId);
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### QR Error Correction

All MedTrace QR codes use **Level H error correction** — meaning up to **30% of the QR code can be damaged or obscured** (torn, wet, partially printed) and the code still scans correctly. This is critical for real-world packaging that gets handled, stored, and transported.

### Inspector Dashboard

MedTrace's Regulatory Inspector module is designed specifically around **India's pharmaceutical regulatory hierarchy**. Multiple central and state-level bodies operate with different jurisdictions, powers, and data access needs — each gets a scoped role inside MedTrace.

---

#### 🏛️ Indian Regulatory Bodies Integrated in MedTrace

India's drug regulation involves a layered system of central and state authorities. MedTrace maps each body to a specific access role:

| Regulatory Body | Full Name | Jurisdiction | MedTrace Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CDSCO** | Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation | National — all medicines, biologicals, medical devices | `central_inspector` — full national read + recall authority |
| **ICMR** | Indian Council of Medical Research | National — research oversight, pharmacovigilance, clinical trial drugs | `icmr_researcher` — read-only + research data export |
| **NPPA** | National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority | National — price compliance, MRP enforcement | `nppa_auditor` — read MRP data + pricing audit |
| **IPC / PVPI** | Indian Pharmacopoeia Commission / Pharmacovigilance Programme of India | National — adverse drug reaction, quality standards | `ipc_auditor` — quality alerts + ADR data |
| **State FDA** | State Food and Drug Administration | State-level — licensing, inspections, state recalls | `state_inspector` — state-scoped read + state recall |
| **DCG(I)** | Drugs Controller General of India | National — highest drug authority, approves all new drugs | `dcgi_authority` — highest access level, national recall |
| **NIB** | National Institute of Biologicals | National — biological medicines, vaccines | `nib_auditor` — read-only for biological product batches |

---

#### 🔬 ICMR — Indian Council of Medical Research

ICMR is India's apex body for biomedical and health research. Within MedTrace, ICMR has a specialised **Research & Pharmacovigilance** access role that gives it unique capabilities beyond standard inspection.

##### Why ICMR Needs Access to MedTrace Data

ICMR uses real-world medicine distribution and consumption data for:
- **Pharmacovigilance** — monitoring adverse drug reactions (ADR) at population scale
- **Drug utilisation studies** — which medicines are being consumed, where, in what quantities
- **Counterfeit medicine epidemiology** — mapping where fake medicines are geographically concentrated
- **Clinical trial drug tracking** — ensuring investigational medicines in trials are properly authenticated
- **Essential medicines monitoring** — tracking availability of Schedule H / National Essential Medicines List drugs across states
- **Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) research** — monitoring antibiotic consumption patterns linked to resistance

##### ICMR Dashboard — Key Views

**1. Pharmacovigilance Signal Board**
Automatically flags batches where the ratio of `recalled` or `invalid` scan responses exceeds a configurable threshold in a given region. For example: if more than 5% of scans for Amoxicillin 250mg in a district return "Invalid" in a 7-day window, ICMR is alerted to a possible counterfeit surge in that area.

**2. Antibiotic Stewardship Monitor**
Tracks dispensing of Schedule H1 antibiotics (Azithromycin, Amoxicillin-Clavulanate, Ciprofloxacin, etc.) by region. Highlights districts with consumption spikes — potential indicators of irrational use or AMR risk — aligned with India's National Action Plan on AMR (NAP-AMR 2017).

**3. Essential Medicines Availability Tracker**
Cross-references MedTrace scan data against the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM 2022). Shows which NLEM medicines have low scan density in tribal / rural districts — indicating potential supply gaps — and flags for PMBJP (Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana) review.

**4. Clinical Trial Supply Chain Monitor**
Any batch registered in MedTrace with the `IMP` (Investigational Medicinal Product) flag is tracked separately. ICMR can see the exact authorised trial sites each IMP batch should reach. Any QR scan of an IMP batch outside a registered trial site triggers an automatic alert to ICMR and the sponsor company.

### Production Floor Security

**Operator Job Code System:**
```
Job Code Properties:
  ├── Unique per batch run
  ├── Single-use (auto-locks at target quantity)
  ├── Time-limited (default 8h, max 24h)
  ├── PIN-protected (4–6 digit operator PIN)
  ├── Supervisor override requires dual authentication
  └── All events immutably logged in Firestore
```

### Data Protection

- **HTTPS Only** — All traffic over TLS 1.3. HTTP redirected to HTTPS.
- **Input Validation** — Zod schema validation on all API endpoints.
- **SQL/NoSQL Injection** — Firestore's typed API prevents injection by design.
- **Replay Protection** — Verification sessions use nonce system.
- **Rate Limiting** — 100 req/min per IP on public endpoints, 1000 req/min for authenticated.
- **CORS** — Restricted to verified domain origins only.
- **CSP Headers** — Content Security Policy prevents XSS.
- **Audit Immutability** — Firestore rules prevent deletion of audit log records.

### Compliance

| Standard | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **OWASP API Security Top 10** | Addressed in API gateway design |
| **CDSCO Schedule M** | Product catalog fields aligned with GMP documentation requirements |
| **GST Act 2017** | CGST + SGST split invoices, HSN code mapping |
| **IT Act 2000** | Digital signatures on invoices, audit logs |
| **WHO PIC/S Guidelines** | Traceability records maintained per recommendation |

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><b>QR scan returns "Invalid" for a newly printed batch</b></summary>

The QR was scanned before Firestore finished writing all medicine records (large batches take 3–5 seconds). Wait and retry. If persistent, check Firebase Functions logs:

```bash
firebase functions:log --only qrGenerate
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Recall not showing in distributor/retailer portal</b></summary>

The distributor must have clicked "Receive & Add to Stock" — units dispatched but not formally received are not in their inventory records and won't trigger the alert.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Batch QR generation times out for large batches</b></summary>

Increase Firebase Function timeout and memory:

```json
// firebase.json
{
  "functions": {
    "timeoutSeconds": 540,
    "memory": "1GB"
  }
}
```

For batches > 50,000 units, use chunked generation — see `lib/qr/batchGenerator.js`.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Login works but dashboard shows blank / infinite spinner</b></summary>

1. Check Firestore rules allow reads for your role
2. Check the `verified: true` field is set on your user document (unverified orgs are blocked)
3. Check browser console for 403 errors from Firestore
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>GST invoice showing 0% tax</b></summary>

Ensure the product's `hsnCode` is set correctly in the Product Catalog. The system maps HSN codes to GST rates via `config.json → gst.hsnRateMap`. Add missing HSN codes there.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Firebase Functions deployment error: "Billing account required"</b></summary>

Firebase Cloud Functions require the **Blaze (pay-as-you-go)** plan. The free quota is 2M invocations/month — sufficient for development and moderate production. Upgrade at [console.firebase.google.com → Billing](https://console.firebase.google.com).
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>POS can't find medicine in search</b></summary>

The retailer must first receive the shipment ("Incoming Stock → Accept Delivery") before the medicine appears in POS inventory. Medicines not formally received cannot be sold.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Push notifications not working for recalls</b></summary>

1. Firebase Cloud Messaging requires HTTPS (not localhost)
2. Users must have allowed browser notifications for the domain
3. Check the `notificationSender` Cloud Function logs for errors
4. Verify `FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID` is correctly set in env vars
</details>

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Does MedTrace work without internet?**
A: Consumer QR verification queues locally and syncs on reconnect. All portal operations (dispatch, receive, POS billing) require internet.

**Q: Can any medicine QR code be scanned, or only those registered in MedTrace?**
A: Only medicines whose QR was generated by MedTrace will verify as "Genuine". Other QR codes return "Invalid" — which is itself useful information to the consumer.

**Q: What prevents a counterfeiter from generating fake QR codes?**
A: Every QR UID contains a checksum and is registered in Firestore at generation. A fake QR won't exist in the database and returns "Invalid". Additionally, UIDs include a manufacturer-specific prefix that cannot be predicted without system access.

**Q: Is this compliant with Indian drug regulations (CDSCO / Schedule M)?**
A: MedTrace is designed to align with CDSCO traceability requirements and Schedule M manufacturing documentation standards. However, it is a software tool — legal compliance depends on how it is deployed within a licensed pharmaceutical operation.

**Q: Can a manufacturer use MedTrace for all product types?**
A: Yes — Tablets, Capsules, Syrups, Injections, Sprays, Drops, Creams, Ointments, and any custom dosage form can be registered.

**Q: What happens to QR codes if the manufacturer account is deleted?**
A: Medicine records persist independently in Firestore. Scans return the last known verified status with a note that the manufacturer account is no longer active.

**Q: Can the same QR code be scanned multiple times?**
A: Yes — each scan is logged with timestamp. The `scanCount` field tracks how many times a unit has been scanned, which can itself be an authenticity signal (a strip scanned 500 times is suspicious).

**Q: Is there a limit on the number of QR codes per batch?**
A: No hard limit. The Cloud Function handles generation in chunks. The largest tested batch in development was 100,000 units (~5 minutes generation time).
